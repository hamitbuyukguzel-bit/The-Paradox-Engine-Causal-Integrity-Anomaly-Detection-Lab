# The Paradox Engine 🧪🔬

**The Paradox Engine** is an advanced scientific research framework designed to combat the "Replication Crisis" and automate methodological rigor. It bridges the gap between **Psychology, Economics, and Data Science** by providing a suite of tools for Bayesian stress-testing, p-hacking detection, and causal discovery.

Developed for researchers who demand "Harvard/Princeton level" integrity, this engine doesn't just analyze data—it challenges the validity of the discovery itself.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Bayesian Hypothesis Stress-Test:** Moves beyond frequentist p-values to assess the "true" strength of evidence using Bayes Factors.
* **P-Hacking Sentinel:** Detects patterns of data-dredging and alerts the researcher to potential overfitting or selection bias.
* **Causal Discovery (EconML Integration):** Distinguishes between mere correlation and actual causation using Double Machine Learning (DML).
* **Anomalous Pattern Recognition:** Identifies outliers not as "errors" to be deleted, but as potential psychological or economic phenomena.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Core Libraries:** `PyMC`, `EconML`, `CausalInference`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`
* **Visualization:** `Streamlit` (for the interactive lab interface)
* **Model Interpretation:** `SHAP` & `LIME`
